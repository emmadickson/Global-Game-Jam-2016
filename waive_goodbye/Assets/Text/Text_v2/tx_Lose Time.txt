In an homage to timeless beauties like Betty White and Marlene Dietrich I voluntarily give up a little bit of my time to appreciate their enduring contribution to the arts. 
Henceforth my time will not be my own, I submit to the taxation of my time while waiving the right to add stipulations. 
I agree that man’s perception of linear time is an allusion and thus the representation of time even within this game is helping to perpetuate a false dichotomy; therefore losing a bit of it doesn’t bother me. 
I sign away a small chunk of my life, it’s only a few seconds but you know when you think about it those add up. 
“Time is an illusion and so is death”- Swamp Man from Avatar the Last Airbender.

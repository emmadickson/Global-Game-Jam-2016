I dissolve any rights to not be the 1000th customer. 
I waive the rights of visual personal space. 
I waive the right to ad-blocker. 
I agree that Pop-Ups are hickeys from the dark web and Iâ€™m into that. 
Heretofore I sign away my right to lock or drop it and agree to only pop it up. 
I agree to remove ad-blocker, I like to live dangerously.

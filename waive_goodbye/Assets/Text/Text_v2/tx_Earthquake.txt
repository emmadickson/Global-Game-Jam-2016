I grant the great catfish Namazu to thrash about and cause disruption. 
I grant the right for a butterfly in the amazon to beat its wings, inevitably causing the violent sliding between the tectonic plates beneath my own feet. 
I agree to allow a geological dance party. 
Japan needs to be closer to California and I agree to make it happen. 
The earth needs to be the like the mechanical bull ride at a sketchy town fair and I agree to be the drunk teenagers riding it. 
As a fan of the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and history I agree to shake it like its 1902.

Death of organization is the first step in the death of capitalism I thereby sign away by own personal organization to support the larger goal of anarchy. 
Heretofore my desk will become much more unmanageable than it was in its previous state. 
I waive the right to personal organization. 
I forfeit my capacity to act upon any impulse to create order within my workspace. 
I give up the right to separate how my papers look and who I am on the inside.

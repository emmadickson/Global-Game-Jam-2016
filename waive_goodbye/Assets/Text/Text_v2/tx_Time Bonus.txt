I agree to extend this game and gain more time. 
I grant the creators of this game permission to give me more time to appreciate their jokes. 
I waive the normal time rules and gratefully accept more. 
I allow the joy that is this game to continue just a little bit longer. 
I acknowledge that the companionship of these waivers is better than the emptiness that came before and I wish to prolong their presence.

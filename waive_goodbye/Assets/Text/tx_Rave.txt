By signing this document I revoke any personal right not to let dat bass drop. 
I LUVV HOUSE MUSICCC <333 and I want to listen to it right now. 
I agree to an impromptu epilepsy screening with the full understanding that I may find the resulting noises and lights unpleasant. 
Heretofore I waive my right to not be exposed to club kid culture, let the glowsticks and strobes commence. 
I hereon promise my eyes and ears to EDM and its supremacy to all other genres.

From this moment onwards I agree to enter “real world mode” in which my mouse will be as unruly as an actual mouse. 
I grant my mouse the right to be as sensitive as I am. 
Heretofore I recognize my mouse’s right to autonomous action and movement. 
As a fan of the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and history I agree to shake it like its 1902. 
I sign away my right to functional equipment.

I waive my right to exist in two dimensions. 
I sign away my right to not wear terrible glasses which may impact my game play. 
I waive my right not to see the world like Carmen and Juni in the home DVD adaption of Spy Kids 3(D). 
To further develop the nation’s worsening eyesight, I vow to obscure my visibility drastically. 
By signing this I hereon dissolve my right not to see the world through rose (and cyan) tinted glasses as Louis Armstrong so famously dictated.

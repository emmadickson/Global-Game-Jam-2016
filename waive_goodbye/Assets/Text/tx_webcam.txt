I waive my right to not face myself. 
I agree to introspection. 
I waive my rights not to be constantly reminded that...U-G-L-Y, I AIN’T GOT NO ALIBI I’M UGLY. 
Mirror Mirror on the Wall who’s the fairest of them all? I genuinely want to know so I agree to be placed under observation in an attempt to determine the answer. 
I hereby allow the observation of my own face.
